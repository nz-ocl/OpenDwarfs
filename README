OpenDwarfs
=============
The OpenDwarfs project provides a benchmark suite consisting of different
computation/communication idioms, i.e., dwarfs, for state-of-art multicore and
GPU systems.  The first instantiation of the OpenDwarfs has been realized in
OpenCL, as described in part in "OpenCL and the 13 Dwarfs: A Work in Progress"
by Feng, Lin, Scogland, and Zhang in the 3rd ACM/SPEC International Conference
on Performance Engineering, April 2012.


The computation/communication idioms are based on the 13 Berkeley Dwarfs:

Benchmark status
----------------

fft
kmeans
lud
nw
spmv
srad
swat

Alpha:
astar
tdm

Requirements
------------

Packages and libraries needed to build and run the applications.

To build:

    opencl >= 1.0 (some apps require 1.1, but we do not yet guarantee support for 1.2 in all applications.)
    autoconf >= 2.63
    autoheader
    automake
    libtool
    gcc
    maker

To run:

    opencl libs

Building
--------

To build all of the included applications for CPU or GPU:

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    $ make
    
To build all of the included applications for an Altera FPGA:

	$ ./autogen.sh
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure --with-AOCL=/path/to/AOCL
    $ make
    
To build only the applications you select, call configure with the --with-apps
option:

    $ ../configure --with-apps=srad,gem,cfd

To see a full list of options and applications:

    $ ../configure --help

Running
-------

See the application-specific README file in each application's directory.
